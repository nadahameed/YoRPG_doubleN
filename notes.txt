- subclasses allow for further organization
- super() takes the value of the superclass
- a protected instance variable is accessible by the class and all its subclasses
  - replace public/private with protected
  - we used this to define the stats of a Character (which had two subclasses, each with several more subclasses)
- constructors are not inherited but can be invoked (which is why we used super())
