## TNPG: doubleN (Nicole Zhou + Duck, Nada Hameed + Ray)
---

#### Protagonist subclasses:
* Warrior: well-rounded in both offense and defense
* Tank: low offense but high defense
* Assassin: low defense but high offense

#### Monster subclasses:
* Goblin: most common monster the protagonist will encounter, higher offense than defense
* Orc: higher defense than offense
* Dragon: has high stats but is the rarest monster

#### Verison to version modifications:
* v0: added Protagonist.java and Monster.java
* v1: added the superclass Character.java
* v2: created at least 3 protagonist subclasses and 3 monster subclasses

#### How can we grow this game?
* We should add more characters into the game, each with unique stats.
* The Monster type could depend on the difficulty (ex: level 3 => higher chance of facing Dragon)
